## Set-Up (Windows)

Make a 'ReeldIn' folder that'll hold our project and clone the repo:

    mkdir Implementation
    cd Implementation
    git clone https://github.com/jonathanhouge/ReeldIn.git .

Next, create and activate a virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv env
    source env/Scripts/activate

Now install the dependencies from requirements.txt and run the set up script:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    sh setup.sh

## Usage

In order to use Tailwind, you'll have to create two terminal tabs, one to start tailwind and the other to start your Django server

In the first terminal type:

    python manage.py tailwind start

You can then start your Django server in a separate tab like this:

    python manage.py runserver

You're now all set and ready to start developing!

## Debugging Set-Up Process

**You've tried 'python manage.py runserver' and seen this error:**

"You have # unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s):
[list].
Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them."

Exactly as it sounds! 'python manage.py makemigrations' was already ran so you have the migration files, you've just
got to run 'python manage.py migrate' to make them run.

**You've tried to run 'sh setup.sh' and seen this error:**

"CommandError: It looks like node.js and/or npm is not installed or cannot be found..."

Whoops! 'npm' can't be found. Go into 'settings.py' and find the variable 'NPM_BIN_PATH' and copy the absolute
path to 'npm.cmd' on your computer.
