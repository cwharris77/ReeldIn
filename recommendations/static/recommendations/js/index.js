As you walk through our questions, we'll query our movie pool for what matches your inputs.
On average, most users will answer ten to twenty questions before having the option to choose a movie.
Note the bottom of the page's counter on how many possible movies remaining meet your criteria. If it ever drops below ten, we'll stop early.
Happy querying!`
